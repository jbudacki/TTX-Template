Table Top Exercise Overview
--------------------
1. Where to start?
Read the MIRTE Cyber Exercise Playbook and well as the NIST 800-84 - Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise Programs for IT Plans and Capabilities.

2. What it is?
Table Top Exercise (TTX) for Computer Security Incident Response (CSIRT) teams. The templatized artifacts provided will hopefully help teams facilitate  their own table top exercises.

3. Our Approach
The TTX scenario is a choose your own adventure exercise, with rewards (hints) for following the correct processes and procedures. The scenario will be easy at first to get the participants in the correct frame of mind.  As the scenario progresses it will start to push the participants and possibly expose gaps in current people, process, and technology.

4. Scenario Summary
Following industry best practice (MITRE Cyber Exercise Playbook) Information Security created a scenario with a choose your own adventure style twist. The scenario focused on situations that have happened at ACME in past incidents. Information Security also focused on incidents that have occurred within the past few quarters within the larger Information Industry. These incidents included the following;
```
  • Social media account takeover by miscreants

  • External media questioning

  • Malware outbreak

  • Normal daily alerts (Compromised asset and Data exfiltration)
  
  • Physical security intrusion

  • Major service offering outage (Customer Portal)
```
5. Scenario Goal
Establish a baseline for future exercises; raise CSIRT awareness and skill.

6. Scenario Objectives
Determine how Information Security staff interact and respond to an incident; validate procedures; observe and describe the process used to Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and recover from simulated events.

7. WebApp Usage
The first page of the WebApp is the introduction (Introduction.html).
Assumptions page (assumptions.html), this where you can establish any rules.
The first inject is on slide1a.html and links to an artifact titled loki.html. Modify to suit your environment.
The rest of the scenario follows the TTX Outline Template and the TTX Flow Chart Template.
